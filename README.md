Examination project in JSR200 - JavaScript Frameworks

This is a school project covering the basics of JavaScript Frameworks. This application specifically is written in React / Next.js and emphasizes operations like useEffect and useState, as well as fetching data from Rest APIs and iterating through it to post on the application.

I'm not particularly proud of how the app looks, it could use a major overhaul, but this is how the project was submitted and so this is how I leave it for now. 

I may revisit it someday to make it pretty as well as fully functional (as the API I was using does not allow for usage outside of local server development without payment, so for now there is no URL to fetch data from to forcibly trigger the "Error loading news."-prompt).
